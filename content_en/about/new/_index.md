## 2021.01.25
- Have you practiced the best and most detailed documentation in the Internet? Mr.üçâ started writting the [level 1 secret script](../../documents/level-1/)...
- The [English version of the documentation website](/en) is gradually being added, thanks to the hard work of all of you!

<br>

## 2021.01.22

### [v1.2.3](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.2.3)
---
- Support for the SS protocol has been enhanced **again**. It supports the use of multiple users on a single port now!
- Support for the trojan protocol has been enhanced **again**, and we have a new way in trojan fallbacks to separate traffic using SNI~!
- _(VLESS: Nyaaaaaa~~)_
- The weird UDP bug has been solved, one word "stable"!
- Sniffing can exclude domains you don't want to sniff, and you will get some new approaches in this area.
- Salution to the big shot who finds the problem -> opens an issue -> tests it himself -> analyzes it himself -> finds the problem himself -> solves it himself -> then submits a PR to upstream and downstream <img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8384161?s=32" width="32px" height="32px" alt="a"/>[@Bohan Yang](https://github.com/bohanyang)!
- There are also other delicious little cherries, just update to taste them as usual.

## 2021.01.19
- Some numbers
    - 10 released tags
    - 100 solved issues
    - 300 forks
    - 2,000 stars
    - 3,000 people in chat group

<br>

## 2021.01.17
- The hard translation work has begun, thanks to <img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/60207794?s=32" width="32px" height="32px" alt="a"/>[@ÁéñÊüíMax](https://github.com/jiuqi9997) and all the big shots who translate.

###  [v1.2.2](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.2.2)
---
- A strange new pose has been unlocked for fallback triage! You can now divide your data based on SNI in your fallbacks~!
- The previously previewed UUID modifications are now live. ([scroll down to see](#2021.01.12))
- The logs now look a little smoother than they did last time.
- The remote DOH has learned to walk by triage just like the rest of the DNS schema.
- And of course all the other little sweets. (Just update the tasting)
- Ah, and by the way, the first man in the world to run xray on M1 was Anthony TSE
## 2021.01.12
---
- The UUID to come will be modified to support mapping between custom strings and UUIDs. This means you will be able to write ids to correspond to users in the configuration file like this.
  - Configuration of the client: `"id": "I will always love Mr.üçâ"`
  - Configuration of the server: `"id": "9017f6ef-7fa9-5afb-a6b4-76648028f1a4"` (this UUID is the UUID map of `I will always love Mr.üçâ`)
- Mr.üçâ's [level 0 documentation](../../documents/level-0/) is finally over, clap clap!

<br />

## 2021.01.10
---
- The [level 0 documentation](../../documents/level-0/) are now online. They are the result of teacherüçâ's hard work, teaching you how to go from nothing to xray proficiency! 
- (Probably the most detailed and patient tutorial on the entire internet that teaches you how to configure from scratch)
- Many articles have also been added to the [transparent proxy](../../documents/level-2/) series.
- There are still a lot of details to change, and the documentation will become more and more standardised! 
- Thanks to [@ricuhkaen](https://github.com/ricuhkaen) , [@BioniCosmos](https://github.com/BioniCosmos), [@kirin](https://github.com/kirin10000).

###  [v1.2.1](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.2.1)
---
- Lots of UDP-related fixes, and you can even play Rainbow Six on Ubisoft's potato servers! 
- Google Voice should also work properly with v2rayNG dialing.
- Logs now look much better.

<br />

## 2021.01.07
---
- Courtesy and respect should have been one of the guidelines that the community did not need to explicitly state.

## 2020.12.24
For some indescribable reason, xray's documentation site has been sneaked online ahead of the release date.<br>
The url is: [yes that's what you're looking at](https://xtls.github.io)

You can check out the various contents and feel free to correct/suggest (you can post to the issue section of the documentation github repository)

The documentation site needs constant refinement and addition of content, as well as refinement of the design. <br>
So all are more than welcome to contribute to the documentation. <br>
[Repository of documents](https://github.com/XTLS/XTLS.github.io)

There is a short tutorial in the repository readme on how to help xray improve the documentation site. <br
Feel free to check it out, correct errors, make changes and add ideas.
